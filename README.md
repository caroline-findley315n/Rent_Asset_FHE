# Rent_Asset_FHE: A FHE-based Universal Game Asset Rental Platform

Rent_Asset_FHE is a pioneering platform designed to securely rent in-game NFT assets, such as weapons and skins, powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This transformative platform allows players to lease their digital game assets safely, ensuring privacy and security through advanced cryptographic conditions.

## The Challenge: Asset Ownership and Security

In the rapidly evolving gaming landscape, players often find themselves with valuable in-game assets that they cannot fully utilize. The current systems lack robust mechanisms for renting or leasing these assets, exposing owners to risks such as asset theft, unfair rental conditions, and a lack of control over their digital property. This creates a substantial barrier for players who wish to generate passive income from their game assets while maintaining their security and ownership rights.

## Embracing the FHE Advantage

Rent_Asset_FHE addresses these challenges by implementing **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption** technology. By utilizing open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, our platform ensures that rental agreements are encrypted and secure. This allows complex and private rental terms to be established while enabling homomorphic verification of the rental status without revealing any sensitive information. 

FHE enables both parties—the asset owner and the renter—to transact with peace of mind, knowing that their personal data and assets remain private and secure throughout the rental process.

## Core Functionalities

- **FHE-Encrypted Rental Terms:** Establish intricate, private rental agreements that protect both the asset owner's and renter's interests.
- **Homomorphic Verification of Rental Status:** Confirm rental agreements without revealing sensitive information, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Enhanced Liquidity for Assets:** Increase the marketability of game assets, allowing players to earn passive income while retaining ownership.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** A sleek interface that allows players to track their assets, manage rental agreements, and oversee transaction history easily.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) SDK:** The backbone for secure and private transactions.
- **Node.js:** For building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat:** To facilitate Ethereum development with a comprehensive environment.
- **Solidity:** The language used for writing smart contracts.

```

## Getting Started

To set up the Rent_Asset_FHE project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- Hardhat (latest version)

### Installation Steps

1. Download the project files and navigate into the project directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This command will fetch all required libraries, including Zama's FHE libraries.

## Building and Running Your Project

Now that the installation is complete, you can build and run the project:

### Compile Smart Contracts

To compile the smart contracts, execute:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Test the Contracts

Run the following command to test the contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy the Contracts

To deploy the contract to a local test network, use:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Example Code: Creating a Rental Agreement

The following code snippet demonstrates how a player can create a rental agreement leveraging the security of FHE:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Rent_Asset_FHE.sol";

contract RentalAgreement {
    Rent_Asset_FHE public rentAsset;

    constructor(address _rentAssetAddress) {
        rentAsset = Rent_Asset_FHE(_rentAssetAddress);
    }

    function createRentalAgreement(
        address assetOwner,
        address renter,
        uint256 assetId,
        uint256 rentalPrice,
        uint256 rentalDuration
    ) public {
        // Create the rental agreement logic here
        // Ensure terms are encrypted and stored securely using FHE
    }
}
```

In this example, the **createRentalAgreement** function allows asset owners and renters to establish a rental agreement, ensuring that details remain private and secure.
